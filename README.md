# Where can I play?

- [You can download the apk here!](https://github.com/devkiloton/SpaceOdyssey/raw/master/space_odissey_apk.apk)

# Why? 

- I used this game to improve my knowledge on Unity Engine, C# language skills and discover how the mobile game development works!

- Also, you can use this project as you wish, be for study or commercial use. Just be careful with the arts, the sounds and their royalties! 

- Any ideas or suggestions:

- Space Odyssey is an Android game based on C# where the player needs to swipe the finger

  on the screen to deviate a spaceship from white balls without crashing on asteroids.

- If you don't touch the screen, the velocity is reduced and you can acess the main menu with the white engine if you want.

- When you crash on asteroids or white balls, the ranking scene will be loaded and you will can enter with your username that will be saved into a Json file!
